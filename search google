Hello
I go straight to the point. 
If you really want to learn anything, not just hacking, at first you need a roadmap that helps you to do steps one by one and in a right way. 
For finding a good roadmap, the best thing is google. 
Just search and get much good ideas about it.
Don't forget that the hacking has many branches, so before searchong for roadmap, you basically need to excactly know what you want... 
You want to learn hacking? Which part of it? for what usage?

So, first find your accurate goal, then search for a good roadmap, then find learning courses and videos and...,and at last practice as you can.
Good luck :)
